Tree DSA Pattern Tracker
Prepared by: Satyam Mishra
Document Type: Structured Study Tracker (Exportable as PDF or Notion Template)
Focus: Mastery of Tree Data Structures through Pattern-Based Learning and LeetCode Practice

Overview
This document provides a comprehensive, pattern-oriented roadmap for mastering Tree-based Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) problems. Designed to streamline preparation for technical interviews, competitive programming, and academic excellence, this tracker integrates high-yield patterns with curated LeetCode problems, sorted from fundamental to advanced.

Key Features
🔍 Concept-Driven Patterns – 15+ key tree problem-solving patterns (e.g., Traversals, Views, LCA, Tree DP)

🔗 LeetCode Integration – Active links to top-rated LeetCode problems for each pattern

✅ Progress Tracking – Checkbox system for marking completion and revision

🧠 Cognitive Learning Path – Logical ordering from foundational to complex concepts

📊 Interview Focused – Aligned with questions asked in FAANG, Tier-1 startups, and academic coding rounds

How to Use
Select a Pattern
Begin with foundational patterns (e.g., BFS/DFS traversal) and gradually move to advanced topics (e.g., Tree Dynamic Programming).

Understand the Logic
Refer to each pattern explanation. Use visual dry runs or pen-and-paper tracing when needed.

Solve LeetCode Problems
Use the provided hyperlinks to practice 2–5 problems per pattern. Prioritize quality over quantity.

Track Your Progress
Use checkboxes to monitor your practice and mark patterns/questions as complete.

Revise Strategically
Revisit completed patterns and problems on a 2-day or 3-day interval to ensure long-term retention.

Outcomes
By completing this tracker, you will be able to:

Identify Tree patterns rapidly in coding interviews

Solve unseen problems by mapping them to known patterns

Build confidence in recursive, iterative, and optimized tree algorithms

Strengthen your resume/project documentation with pattern-backed learning
